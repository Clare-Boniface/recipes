<h3>Traditional Toad in the hole</h3>
<p>Toad in the hole is classic comfort food at its best. Serve with plenty of gravy and simple steamed vegetables.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>115g plain flour</li>
<li>large pinch of salt</li>
<li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>4 large free-range eggs</li>
<li>300ml milk</li>
<li>30g fresh thyme leaves</li>
<li>8 good quality pork sausages</li>
<li>30g Dijon mustard</li>
<li>30g of beef dripping or white vegetable fat for vegetarians</li>
<li>knob of butter, to serve</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>To make the batter, sift the flour into a large bowl. Add the salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Make a well in the centre of the flour and crack in the eggs. Using a wooden spoon, gradually beat the eggs into the flour then slowly beat in the milk until the batter is the consistency of double cream.</li>
<li>Strain and push any remaining lumps through a sieve. Stir in the thyme. Cover and leave to stand for 30 minutes, or ideally 3-4 hours.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.</li>
<li>Heat a large non-stick pan and cook the sausages over a medium heat until golden-brown all over. (If you do not have a non-stick pan add a little oil.) Turn off the heat and brush the sausages with the mustard. Set aside.</li>
<li>Place the dripping or white vegetable fat into an ovenproof dish and heat in the oven for five minutes or until the dripping is hot and hazy.</li>
<li>Add the sausages to the hot dish and pour in the batter. Immediately return the dish to the oven and cook for 35-40 minutes until well-risen and golden-brown.</li>
<li>Serve seasoned with black pepper and a large knob of butter.</li>
